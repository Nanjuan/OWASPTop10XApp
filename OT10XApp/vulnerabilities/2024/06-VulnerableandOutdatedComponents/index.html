    This demonstration simulates a vulnerability caused by using an outdated library.
    Here, we are deliberately loading jQuery version 1.7.2 â€“ a version known to be outdated and with potential security issues.
  </p>
  
  <!-- Simulate loading an outdated library -->
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"></script>
  
  <p>Using jQuery 1.7.2 may expose your application to known vulnerabilities, such as XSS attacks.</p>
